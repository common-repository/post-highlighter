Post Hightlight Plugin lets your users read post without any visual disturbace.

== Description ==

I have written this plugin to Highlight the Post Contents only among all the stuff on the page. It allow the readers to just focus on what you wrote while he is reading. This plugin adds a switch button on top of each Post as Light off/on.

When it is switched off, all the contents of Page are darken but the Post until you turn it on again. It is very light plugin.
